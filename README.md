# CodeSLO-Part4
CodeSLO class 4

Modification of the Git repository by Matt West https://github.com/matt-codeslo/css-responsive.git for class 4 of the CodeSLO meetup.  

CSS was modified to include media queries for Galaxy S III, Ipad Pro, and a laptop.  I also added a background to the Bio Section
